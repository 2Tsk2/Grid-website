          About me:
        </h1>
      </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        I am a web developer with atleast 7 years of experience with various frameworks and tools such as TailwindCSS,
        Bootstrap, React, Svelte,
        NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, and many more. I have worked on various projects and have a good understanding
        of the web development industry
        as a whole. <br>
        <br>
        On my spare time, I usually play video games like Elden ring , Valorant (sometimes), Osu (standard mania, and
        taiko ) and much more but when I get bored with playing i usually
        just code while listening to music. <br>
        <br>

        Currently, I am studying at San francisco High school as a first year TVL ICT student, I don't really
        have much interest in having high grades
        and I usually hang out at the teachers table while playing on my laptop (not gonna specify what section).<br>

        This website acts as my output for the last activity of my programming class although I may use it for other
        things in the future.

      <p>
       Personally, I quite like this activity as It makes me show what i can do with the knowledge that i have gained from the past 6 months of 
       learning pure css and html as ive been mainly using frameworks for their ease of use and speed of development. <br>
        <br>
        This activity also remove the restraints on what i can output which was nice because im allowed to show what i can do without any limiting factors.

      <p>
      I cant think of much to put here so ill just put some random facts about me. <br> <br>

      Im a top 50k OSU standard player, I also play the electric guitar (telecaster) from time to time but im not particularly good at it because
      I just borrow it for practice from a close "friend" of mine. <br>
      <br>
      I also like wasting my time on learning new frameworks for web development from time to time but what really interests me are compiled languages like
      C# and C++. I also like to play around with machine learning and AI but I dont really have much experience with it to actually
      call myself good at it. <br>
