      <p> Hi, im Julius Castillejo, more commonly known as tsk. I am a 18 years old web and software developer with atleast 11 years of experience with 
        Various programming languages and frameworks such as C, C++, Python and the ruby on rails stack. I have worked on various projects in said fields and
        have a good grasp of the software development industry as a whole. <br>
        <br> On my spare time, I usually play rhythm games with my friends or do freelance work on the side. <br>
        <br> Currently studying BS Information Technology at the Polytechnic Institute of The Philippines As of 09/09/2024. <br>
       <br> I don't really have much interest in having high grades so don't expect much in that regard. <br>

      <p> this was a website of particular significance that i like updating from time to time (2024 last update) <br>
        <br> sometimes i also like updating it when something new happens in my life like breakups and job shit arises.

        <div></div>
      </div>
      <p> I cant think of much to put here so ill just put some random facts about me. <br>
        <br> Im a 14k rating maimai player, I also play the electric guitar (telecaster) from time to time but thats on hiatus at the 
        moment as i broke my telecaster's pickup. <br>
        <br> I also like wasting my time on learning new frameworks for web development from time to time but what
        really interests me are compiled languages like C# and C++. I also like to play around with machine learning and
        AI but I dont really have much experience with it to actually call myself good at it. <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes I also take comissions for people who want to have a website made for them but I usually dont partake
        in larger projects that require me to commit to something for a long duration because of school and other factors.
       (outdated, got alot of freelance software development jobs within the past year or so.)
